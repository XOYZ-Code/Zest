## Inspiration

I got the idea from this project when I was trying to print som posters from some series myself. I found that there are many options but the ones I wanted were often only available in low res. Then it got to me. Why not make a neural network for this? This way I could learn how a NN functions and sharpen my skills.

Since the start of this project in March 2020 there were many atempts from me. It didn't got easier when I decieded to not use any of the popular libaries. Only numpy should be enough for everything.

I got my inspiration for the new and probably final version from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/procode/neural-network-without-libraries/notebook). With this I officially renamed the project from 'image_upscaler' to 'Zest'. Why Zest? Well I like anime and I thought it would be nice to name Projects based on characters from animes I like.
